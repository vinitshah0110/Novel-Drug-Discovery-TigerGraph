        "* Given the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. \n",
        "* The evaluation and filtering phase is therefore time consuming and hardly expressible to the intended audience. **The proposed method applies natural language processing (NLP) on article meta data and a k-means clustering algorithm to automatically convert large article corpora into a distribution of focal topics.** This allows efficient filtering as well as objectifying the process through the discussion of the clustering results. \n",
        "* In order, to **find meaning in the clusters, topic modeling will be performed to find the keywords of each cluster**.\n",
        "* By using Bokeh, the plot will be interactive. Hovering over points on the plot will give basic information like title and abstract. This tool was created to help make it easier for trained professionals to sift through many, many publications related to the virus, and find their own determinations.\n",
        "* With over 57,000 scholarly articles on the coronavirus family, it is extremely difficult for the medical researchers to go through this tremendous amount of research papers, hence very difficult to get useful insights about the new Covid-19 pandemic. **The main goal is to implement a semantic-based search rather a keyword-based search.**\n",
        "* Instead of comparing occurences and counts, we will use gensim's word2vec in order to generate word embedding using the abstract texts as our corpus. For each document, we calculate the centroid of its abstract and for each query word, we map it to a vector then calculate the word centroid similarity for the query and each document's abstract. The top ranked papers are then selected and output."
